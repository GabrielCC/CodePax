<h1>CodePax - Installation</h1>
<h2>General considerations</h2>
<p>CodePax must be installed on every environment you want to control. In case your application has one instance on a dev server and another one on a staging server, CodePax needs to be deployed for both of them.</p>

<p>Usually CodePax is placed under an alias such as yourapp.dev.domain.com/codepax/. A good practice is to use the .htaccess file inside public dir to restrict the access based on the incoming IP addresses. Beside that you can employ a HTTP basic auth to further restrict the access.</p>

CodePax need the following applications and tools to work:
<ul>
<li>a web server, like: Apache, Nginx, IIS, etc</li>
<li>a Subversion command line client (SlikSvn works well for Windows)</li>
<li>PHP 5.2 or higher</li>
<li>the following PHP extensions must be enabled depending of the set-up options you want to follow:</li>
- PDO_mysql - in case database versioniong is enabled and you use MySQL<br>
- PDO_pgsql - in case PostgreSQL is your database of choice<br>
- SqlSrv - a driver actively maintained by Microsoft http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/cc296152(v=sql.90).aspx<br>
- Zip extension - in case you want to use the "preserve test data" functionality under the Database versioning<br>
<li>you need a Subversion user with read-write access for the repo you will be using</li>
<li>rename config.sample.php to config.php (the file is under /src/application/config/) and fill in the appropriate constants by following the inline code comments</li>
</ul>

<h2>Database versioning</h2>
<p>In order to benefit of the database versioning system, you need to make one time configurations on every environment you plan to use CodePax.
Staging (STG)</p>
This should be the first one to start with.
<ul>
<li>manually synchronize the PROD database with the one on STG. The most important is to have the latest database structure on STG.</li>
<li>generate the versioning table by running /utils/generate_db_versions_table.php</li>
</ul>

<h2>Configuring the project</h2>
Below you will find the necessary steps you must take in order to setup CodePax for your project:
<h3>STG</h3>
<ul>
<li>The database from the PROD server is dumped and then uploaded on the STG server</li>
<li>From the CodePax root run the script /utils/generate_db_versions_table.php</li>
<li>The code is switched on the trunk(only if it this hasn't been done before this)</li>
<li>The necesary folder structure is created. Apache or the web server provider of your choosing must be given write rights to these folders:</li>
- /project_root/DB_VERSIONING_DIR/baselines/<br>
- /project_root/DB_VERSIONING_DIR/change_scripts/<br>
- /project_root/DB_VERSIONING_DIR/data_change_scripts/<br>
- /project_root/DB_VERSIONING_DIR/test_data/<br>
</ul>
<p>DB_VERSIONING_DIR is a constant definded in the CodePax config.</p>
<ul>
<li>A test data file must be created at this location: /project_root/DB_VERSIONING_DIR/test_data/data.sql . If time is short, the test data file can be created as an empty file but it is mandatory it exists.</li>
<li>Using the SVN client of your choosing, add and commit these folders to your project. An explanatory message should be used like "created directory structure for DataBase versioning"</li>
<li>From the CodePax root run the script: /utils/generate_baseline.php</li>
<li>A tag with the content is created.</li>
</ul>
<h3>PROD</h3>
<ul>
<li>From the CodePax root run the script: /utils/generate_db_versions_table.php</li>
<li>The first entry in the table is entered manually, with baseline 1.0.0 (INSERT INTO z_db_versions (major,minor,point,script_type,date_added) VALUES(1,0,0,1, NOW()))</li>
<li>A switch to the tag above will be performed</li>
</ul>
<h3>DEV</h3>
<ul>
<li>From the CodePax root run the script: /utils/generate_db_versions_table.php</li>
<li>The first entry in the table is entered manually, with baseline 1.0.0 (INSERT INTO z_db_versions (major,minor,point,script_type,date_added) VALUES(1,0,0,1, NOW()))</li>
</ul>
