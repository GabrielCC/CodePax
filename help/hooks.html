<h1>CodePax - Hooks</h1>
<p>In order to allow on-demand scripts execution within Codepax, a basic hook system was set to place.
Basically when the Hooks are activated(by setting the "USE_HOOKS" constant to "true") a Hooks section will appear on the interface and all the found hooks will be listed there.</p>

<h2>How to use hooks</h2>
The hooks must be placed under "/hooks/" directory which is relative to Codepax directory structure
<ul>
<li>every hook must exist within a directory, let's say "SampleHook"</li>
<li>the hook directory must contain at least the hook file named "Handler.php", with the class name, in this case "SampleHook_Handler.php"</li>
<li>the hook class must implement the "CodePax_Hooks_Interface"</li>
<li>you can place other files too under hook directory</li>
</ul>
